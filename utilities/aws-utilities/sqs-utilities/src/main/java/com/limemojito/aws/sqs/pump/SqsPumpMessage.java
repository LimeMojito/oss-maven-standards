/**
 * The {@code SqsPumpMessage} class represents a message received from an Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) queue.
 * Each instance of this class contains the actual message payload and optional attributes associated with the message.
 *
 * <p>
 * This class is immutable and follows the value object pattern. Once created, the values of the {@code SqsPumpMessage}
 * instance cannot be modified.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The message payload is stored in the {@code message} field, which can hold any Java object. The optional attributes
 * associated with the message are stored in the {@code attributes} field, which is a map of string keys to arbitrary
 * object values.
 * </p>
 *
 *
 * <h2>Usage:</h2>
 *
 * <pre>
 * SqsPumpMessage message = new SqsPumpMessage(payload, attributes);
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Serialization:</h2>
 *
 * <p>
 * This class is annotated with Lombok's {@code @Value} annotation, and therefore provides both {@code equals()},
 * {@code hashCode()}, and {@code toString()} methods based on the values of its fields.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * To serialize/deserialize instances of this class, a framework such as JSON or XML serialization can be used.
 * </p>
