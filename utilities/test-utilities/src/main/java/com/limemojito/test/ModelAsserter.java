/**
 * The ModelAsserter class is used to assert the behavior of a model object by performing several tests. It provides
 * methods to assert the canonical behavior, the accessibility of
 * getters and setters, and the serialization and deserialization of the model object to and from JSON.
 *
 * <p>The class contains a single static method, {@code assertModelBehaviour}, which takes the model object to test, a duplicate object (expected to have the same ID), a "different
 * " object for comparison, and an optional list of properties to ignore during the getter and setter accessibility test. The method performs the following tests:</p>
 * <ol>
 *     <li>Checks the canonical behavior by asserting equals, hashCode, and toString methods.</li>
 *     <li>Checks the accessibility of all getters and setters of the model object, ignoring the specified properties.</li>
 *     <li>Checks the serialization and deserialization of the model object to and from JSON.</li>
 * </ol>
