/**
 * The EnumAsserter class provides a utility method for asserting that an enum class
 * follows certain conventions.
 * <p>
 * To use this class, call the {@code assertEnum} method with the enum class to be
 * asserted. The method checks that the enum's constants, the result of calling its
 * "values" method, and the result of calling its "valueOf" method with each constant's
 * name, are all equal.
 * <p>
 * Example usage:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * public enum MyEnum {VALUE1, VALUE2, VALUE3}
 *
 * public class MyEnumTest {
 *     @Test
 *     public void shouldPassAssertEnum() {
 *         EnumAsserter.assertEnum(MyEnum.class);
 *     }
 * }
 * }</pre>
 * <p>
 * Note that this class is not meant to be instantiated, as it only contains a static
 * utility method.
