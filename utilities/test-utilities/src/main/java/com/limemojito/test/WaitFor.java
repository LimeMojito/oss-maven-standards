/**
 * The {@code WaitFor} class provides utility methods for waiting for a specific situation to become true.
 * It allows you to specify a maximum wait time and a polling delay to continuously check the situation until it becomes true.
 * If the situation does not become true within the specified time, an exception is thrown.
 *
 * <p>This class is deprecated and is not recommended for use. Use Awaitility instead.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>To use the {@code WaitFor} class, you need to implement the {@link SituationToBecomeTrue} interface and provide
 * a custom implementation for the {@code situation} method, which defines the condition that needs to be met.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>Example usage:</p>
 * <pre>{@code
 *     WaitFor.waitFor(10, () -> {
 *         // Check if the situation is true
 *         // Return true if the situation is met, false otherwise
 *     });
 * }</pre>
 *
 * @see org.awaitility.Awaitility
